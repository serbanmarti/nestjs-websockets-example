NestJS WebSockets Example
</p>
<p style="font-weight: bolder; text-align: center">
Authentication, Authorization & Pipes
</p>

## Description

This is a simple example project of how to use WebSockets with NestJS,
and implement features like Authentication, Authorization & Pipes.

Included is also a `client.html` file that you can use to play around with the WebSocket connection.
The implementation of the client is very minimal, and only serves as a way to test the WebSocket connection.

## Run the project

```bash
$ docker compose up --build -d
```
